# Frontiers
  - The Solution is composed by two projects: one Api and the other based on Blazor Server. I wasn't able to finish the part related to the registration of an user (just the frontend part), the api has been built.
  - Unfortunately I wasn't able to connect the containers, so the FrontiersApp container cannot communicate with backend api, because of missing the configuration of the network between the two container.
  - So that, even I provide you the docker images to execute and run them, you won't be able execute it, because of the previous point.
  - I am available for any discussion or further details
